# 🧮 Factorial and Math Operations Program

This Python program performs two main tasks:

1. **Calculates the factorial** of a non-negative integer using a recursive function.
2. **Performs mathematical operations** (square root, natural logarithm, and sine) on a user-provided number using the `math` module.

---

## 📌 Features

### ✅ Factorial Calculation

- Uses a recursive function to compute the factorial of a non-negative integer.
- Handles edge cases like negative input with an appropriate message.

### ✅ Math Operations (`task2()`)

- Prompts the user to enter a number.
- Calculates and displays:
  - Square root
  - Natural logarithm (base *e*)
  - Sine (in radians)
- Uses Python’s built-in `math` module.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

1. Run the script using Python 3:
   ```python3 python script_name.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter a non-negative integer to calculate its factorial.
   - Enter a number to perform math operations.

## 🧠 Example Output

```
Enter a non-negative integer to calculate its factorial: 5
factorial of 5 = 120

Enter a number: 3.14
Square root of 3.14 = 1.772004514666935
Natural logarithm of 3.14 = 1.144222799920162
Sine of 3.14 (in radians) = 0.0015926529164868282
```

## ⚠️ Notes

- The factorial function does not accept negative numbers.
- The logarithm function requires a positive number as input.
- The sine function expects the input in radians.
